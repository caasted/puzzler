# Chris's Puzzler Project
For the VR Developer Nanodegree at Udacity, I designed, tested, and iterated on a mobile VR app called Puzzler. In this app the user enters a dungeon and plays a game of Simon says in order to solve the puzzle and exit the dungeon.

### Unique Considerations
There were many design considerations taken into account for this project, including scale, thematic lighting and sound, and user comfort during sequences involving motion.

## Puzzler
This project was successful thanks to an iterative approach that was used to make improvements to the game. My test users and I have enjoyed playing it and I hope many others will too.

## Design process
**Statement of Purpose:** Puzzler is a mobile VR application for new VR users that challenges them to solve a familiar type of puzzle in a new way.

### Persona
For this project I created a user persona called Tim:

## User testing outcomes and iteration

Testing the scene and atmosphere
I conducted a user test with one user who had minimal prior experience with VR to determine if the scale for the environment I was creating was accurate. I asked the user to go into the environment and estimate how big they were. If
