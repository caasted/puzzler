# Chris's Puzzler Project
As part of my coursework with Udacity, I designed, tested, and iterated on a mobile VR experience called Puzzler. In this game, players enter a gloomy dungeon with surreal looking orbs, and are asked to solve a puzzle similar to a 3D Simon says to move on.

### Unique Considerations
There were many interesting design considerations during this project, but the most notable was the need to design a space so that the users could intuitively understand the object of the game in a simple mobile experience.

## Puzzler
This project was a huge success thanks to the careful intuitive approach that was used to consistently improve the game. People have had a ton of fun trying out VR and playing this game, and everyone intuitively understands how to interact with the space.

## Design process
**Statement of Purpose:** Puzzler is a mobile VR application for new VR users that challenges them to solve a familiar type of puzzle in a new way.

### Persona
For this project I created a user persona called Tim:

Tim, 28 – Sales Representative

“I like playing quick games between tasks at work.”

Tim knows his way around a smart phone and is familiar with mobile gaming, but is relatively new to virtual reality apps. He prefers his entertainment to be fast, fun, and rewarding.

## User testing outcomes and iteration

Testing the scene and atmosphere
I conducted a user test with one user who had minimal prior experience with VR to determine if the scale for the environment I was creating was accurate. I asked the user to go into the environment and estimate how big they were. If
